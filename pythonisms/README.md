# Class 42: Pythonisms


Added demo code from [this repo](https://github.com/codefellows/seattle-python-401n2/blob/main/class-42/demo/linked_list_iterator.py)

- Love the idea of taking any data structure and making it iterable - easily! 
- Decorators allow us to wrap another function in order to extend the behavior of the wrapped function, without permanently modifying it [Source](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/decorators-in-python/#:~:text=Decorators%20are%20very%20powerful%20and,function%2C%20without%20permanently%20modifying%20it.)
- Generator functions allow you to declare a function that behaves like an iterator [Source](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-and-why-you-should-use-python-generators-f6fb56650888/#:~:text=Generators%20have%20been%20an%20important,%2C%20easy%2C%20and%20clean%20way.)
